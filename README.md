# golden-layout-react-redux
**Note: this is a work in progress...I haven't found a solution yet.**

Minimal example showing how to link redux state to react components embedded within golden-layout.

Run `npm install`, then `npm run dev` and point your browser to `localhost:8080` to run the example.

The example consists of three golden-layout tabs, each with a single React component. There are two buttons and one label which displays a count stored in the Redux state. The buttons increment or decrement this count.
